                    wind down and prepare for sleep. Engage in relaxing activities such as reading, taking a warm bath,
                    or practicing gentle yoga stretches to promote relaxation and prepare your mind and body for sleep.

                <p class="text-blue-900">Create a sleep-friendly environment by keeping your bedroom cool, dark, and
                    quiet. Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows that support proper spinal alignment and promote
                    restful sleep. Remove electronic devices and minimize noise to minimize disruptions and optimize
                    sleep quality.</p>

                    and relax the body before bedtime. Mindfulness techniques can help reduce stress, anxiety, and
                    racing thoughts that may interfere with sleep, allowing you to drift off more easily and enjoy more

                <p class="text-blue-900">Avoid stimulants such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol close to bedtime, as
                    they can interfere with your ability to fall asleep and stay asleep. Additionally, limit screen time
                    before bed, as exposure to blue light from electronic devices can disrupt your body's natural
                    sleep-wake cycle and inhibit melatonin production.</p>

                    time every day, even on weekends. Consistency helps regulate your body's internal clock and promote
                    better sleep quality and overall health. Avoid sleeping in or napping excessively, as it can disrupt
                    your sleep-wake cycle and lead to daytime fatigue.</p>

                    sleep quality and duration. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of
                    the week, but avoid vigorous exercise close to bedtime, as it may interfere with your ability to
                    fall asleep.</p>

                    a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid heavy meals,
                    spicy foods, and caffeine close to bedtime, as they can cause discomfort and disrupt your sleep.</p>
